CyberDollar is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The CyberDollar Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the CyberDollar blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the CyberDollar network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

**Website:** [cyberchain.info](https://cyberchain.info)

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with CyberDollar Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by CyberDollar Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `cyberdollar-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `cyberdollar-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Such ports

CyberDollar Core by default uses port `22333` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `22555` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   22333 |   44888 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   22555 |   44555 |   18332 |
